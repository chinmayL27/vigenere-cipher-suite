The Vigenère cipher's primary weakness is its key's repeating nature, where if a cryptanalyst correctly guesses the key's length n, the cipher text can be treated as n interleaved Caesar ciphers, which can easily be broken individually. 
The key length may be discovered by brute force testing each possible value of n (with computational limits).

By using a key of length equal to at least the message length, we get closer to the notion of perfect security provided certain conditions on the key selected from the key space.

  1. Random variable k (key) is uniformly distributed over K (Key Space)
and since the property => Pr[E(k, m0) = c] = Pr[E(k, m1) = c] for all m0, m1 ∈ M, and all c ∈ C

Thus, we can say that this encryption scheme is perfectly secure. And provides support for the intuition that the encrypted message remains “well hidden,” even after seeing its encryption.

NOTE: This is a one-time pad property and essentially eliminates the weakness in Vigenère due to pattern analysis.
